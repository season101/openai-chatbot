# openai-chatbot
A sample project to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenAI in creating the custom ChatBot to assist the customers on the webpage.

## Business Challenge
A user might find it difficult to Navigate through loops of website links. 

## Solution
Leveraging the OpenAI's chatGPT, website content can be tokenized, and be converted to embeddings using openAI. This model will be able to answer questions on chat Format.

# Demo
In this Jupyter Notebook, first python script scrapes through website using Beautiful Soup and downloads html contents, in this instance `ulm.edu` and generates **9533** text content file. Then it is tokenized and converted to embeddings.
